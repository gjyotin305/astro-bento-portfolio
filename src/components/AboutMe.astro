    Hello, I'm Jyotin Goel, a third-year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur, where I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.
        <br />
        My primary tools of choice includes:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>PyTorch</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Golang</li>
        <li>Docker</li>
        <li>Kubernetes</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="text-sm font-light">
      You'll often find me diving into deep learning papers, trying to crack the code on getting those behemoth models to run on low compute. I also dabble in Kaggle competitions when the mood strikes.    
      </p>

    Hot take: For most tasks, ML >>>> DL. Prove me wrong.
    (Also, all hail Lord XGBoost!)
